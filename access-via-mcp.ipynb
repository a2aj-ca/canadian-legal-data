    "# A2AJ Canadian Legal Data via MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you want to give AI agents access to the A2AJ's Canadian Legal Data, so that agents can look up or search case law, legislation or regulations? The A2AJ now has an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, providing a standardized way for AI assistants and applications to access Canadian legal data. This notebook demonstrates how to connect to and use the A2AJ MCP server through both web interfaces and programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access the A2AJ MCP: https://api.a2aj.ca/mcp\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation about MCPs: https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that standardizes how AI assistants connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a universal adapter that allows different AI systems to plug into the same data sources using a consistent interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of each AI platform requiring custom integrations, MCP provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardized communication: Any MCP-compatible system can connect to any MCP server\n",
    "- Tool discovery: AI systems can automatically understand what functions are available\n",
    "- Type safety: Clear parameter definitions and return types\n",
    "- Stateless operation: Each request is independent, making systems more reliable\n",
    "- Resiliance: When hosts make changes to APIs, it can break tools that rely on access to those APIs, \n",
    "whereas changes made to MCPs can be automatically integrated\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many advantages to MCPs, they do also have some disadvantages. For simple tasks, \n",
    "programmatic access via APIs may be easier. Moreover, MCPs are a new technology that is undergoing\n",
    "rapid development, which comes with risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How MCPs are accessed\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-technical users, the easiest way to connect an AI assistant with an MCP is through the AI assistant's web interface or desktop application. For example, users with paid accounts with OpenAI can connect ChatGPT to the A2AJ MCP, and users with paid accounts with Anthropic can connect Claude to an MCP. After connceting to the A2AJ MCP, the AI assistant will be able to access A2AJ Canadian Legal Data, which will allow the AI assistant to do things like get the full text of court cases or run text searches on legislation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more technical users, MCPs can be access programmatically. Several of the leading AI providers have integrated MCPs into their APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What This Notebook Covers\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate two ways to use the A2AJ MCP server:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programmatic Access: How to interact with MCP servers directly from Python code, using OpenAI's responses API as an example\n",
    "- AI Interface Access: How to add the A2AJ MCP connector to AI assistants, using Anthropic's Claude as an example\n",
    "\n",
    "Important note: This A2AJ MCP is designed for searching and retrieving small numbers of documents. If you need to access bulk data for large-scale analysis, consider downloading the Hugging Face dataset or parquet files instead, as described in the accompanying notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another Important Note: AI agents can hallucinate or can make mistakes, including when connected to data sources like the A2AJ's Canadian Legal Data. Always double check important data."
