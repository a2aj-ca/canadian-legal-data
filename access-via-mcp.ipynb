    "# A2AJ Canadian Legal Data via MCP\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you want to give AI agents access to the A2AJ's Canadian Legal Data, so that agents can look up or search case law, legislation or regulations? The A2AJ now has an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server, providing a standardized way for AI assistants and applications to access Canadian legal data. This notebook demonstrates how to connect to and use the A2AJ MCP server through both web interfaces and programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Access the A2AJ MCP: https://api.a2aj.ca/mcp\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation about MCPs: https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "MCP (Model Context Protocol) is an open protocol that standardizes how AI assistants connect to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a universal adapter that allows different AI systems to plug into the same data sources using a consistent interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of each AI platform requiring custom integrations, MCP provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Standardized communication: Any MCP-compatible system can connect to any MCP server\n",
    "- Tool discovery: AI systems can automatically understand what functions are available\n",
    "- Type safety: Clear parameter definitions and return types\n",
    "- Stateless operation: Each request is independent, making systems more reliable\n",
    "- Resiliance: When hosts make changes to APIs, it can break tools that rely on access to those APIs, \n",
    "whereas changes made to MCPs can be automatically integrated\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are many advantages to MCPs, they do also have some disadvantages. For simple tasks, \n",
    "programmatic access via APIs may be easier. Moreover, MCPs are a new technology that is undergoing\n",
    "rapid development, which comes with risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How MCPs are accessed\n",
    "\n",
    "For non-technical users, the easiest way to connect an AI assistant with an MCP is through the AI assistant's web interface or desktop application. For example, users with paid accounts with OpenAI can connect ChatGPT to the A2AJ MCP, and users with paid accounts with Anthropic can connect Claude to an MCP. After connceting to the A2AJ MCP, the AI assistant will be able to access A2AJ Canadian Legal Data, which will allow the AI assistant to do things like get the full text of court cases or run text searches on legislation.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more technical users, MCPs can be access programmatically. Several of the leading AI providers have integrated MCPs into their APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What This Notebook Covers\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate two ways to use the A2AJ MCP server:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Programmatic Access: How to interact with MCP servers directly from Python code, using OpenAI's responses API as an example\n",
    "- AI Interface Access: How to add the A2AJ MCP connector to AI assistants, using Anthropic's Claude as an example\n",
    "\n",
    "Important note: This A2AJ MCP is designed for searching and retrieving small numbers of documents. If you need to access bulk data for large-scale analysis, consider downloading the Hugging Face dataset or parquet files instead, as described in the accompanying notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another Important Note: AI agents can hallucinate or can make mistakes, including when connected to data sources like the A2AJ's Canadian Legal Data. Always double check important data."

      "**Summary of the Latest Canadian Human Rights Tribunal Decision Involving Racial Discrimination (2025 CHRT 64 – Chow v. The Toronto-Dominion Bank, June 24, 2025):**\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "**Background:**\n",
      "- The complainant, Alden Chow, is a customer of Toronto-Dominion Bank (“TD”) who alleges racial discrimination under section 5 of the Canadian Human Rights Act.\n",
      "- The incident occurred when Mr. Chow, who is of Asian descent, went to a TD branch to deposit a cheque. After entering his PIN, the TD employee asked additional questions to verify his identity (regarding age and accounts), reportedly because he looked younger than the age showing in the TD system.\n",
      "- Mr. Chow was concerned these questions and the request for photo identification were unnecessary and discriminatory. He complied but later filed a complaint with TD and, unsatisfied with the response, brought the matter before the Canadian Human Rights Commission (CHRC), which then referred the complaint to the Tribunal.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tribunal Ruling:**\n",
      "- The ruling deals with Mr. Chow’s request for additional document disclosure from TD, including anti-fraud and security policy documents, communications, and internal audits about racial bias.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Findings:**\n",
      "- The Tribunal allowed some of Mr. Chow’s document requests (such as specific policy documents and communications relevant to his alleged experience of discrimination), but denied others (broad requests for anti-fraud policies and internal audits about general racial bias, which were deemed not closely connected to the particular facts at issue or already publicly available).\n",
      "- The Tribunal reiterated the principle that disclosure at this stage is about ensuring fairness in preparation for the hearing, not about producing every document that might touch on wider company practices.\n",
      "- The Tribunal found that requests for broad anti-fraud/security policies, past fraud lists, and unrelated internal audits were overly speculative or not proportionate to the case’s main issue.\n",
      "- The Tribunal underlined that the fact of document disclosure does not mean the documents will become evidence at the hearing, and some information ordered produced is subject to strict confidentiality undertakings.\n",
      "- The Tribunal ruled that it does not have the authority to award legal costs.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Outcome:**\n",
      "- TD was ordered to provide Mr. Chow with certain policies and documents circumscribed to his case.\n",
      "- Most broad “fishing expedition” requests were denied.\n",
      "- No costs were awarded.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**Significance:**  \n",
      "This ruling highlights the Tribunal’s approach to balancing the rights of complainants to a fair process (via adequate disclosure) with the need to avoid overly broad or speculative requests. It clarifies that while racial discrimination complaints are to be fully and fairly adjudicated, only relevant and proportionate disclosure that bears on the facts of the specific complaint will be ordered.\n",
