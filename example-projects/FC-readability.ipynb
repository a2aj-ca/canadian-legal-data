    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In immigration judicial reviews in Canada's Federal Court from August 2020 to August 2025, there are substantial differences across Federal Court judges who decided 50 or more cases in terms of the median length of their decisions, from approximately 800 words for Justice Heneghan to approximately 4,900 words for Justice Kane. Similarly, there are differences in median Flesch Reading Ease scores across judges, from 25.6 for Justice Nowak to 42.5 for Justice Grammond.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some gendered patterns, with a median word count for female justices of 2,274 compared to a median word count for male justices of 2,679. Readability also differs, although the difference is not large: female judges score 32.8 and male judges 34.3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the decisions, some of these differences are likely attributable to patterns in the proportion of decisions delivered orally from the bench.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, some justices do appear to write shorter and less complex decisions on average compared to others. \n",
    "\n",
    "To the extent that this is valued -- for example due to efficiency or accessibility -- the Federal Court might find it helpful to examine more closely why some judges have different scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it is worth noting that this analysis uses simple metrics to demonstrate the potential of legal datasets. There is scholarship that suggests using more sophisticated metrics to measure readability in judicial decisions. See, for example:\n",
